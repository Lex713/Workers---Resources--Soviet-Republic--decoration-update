# Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic: decoration update

Windows batch script that makes all your downloaded buildigns from decoration category free to build, no collision and remove all connections while preserving custom name string and loyalty bonus. It will also make a backup of edited files so you can easily revert changes. There is no way to automatically revert backup version other than manually reverting backup made by script or redownloading edited mod from worksop.

To use download it to "..\steamapps\workshop\content\784150\monuments.bat" and run once before launching game if you downloaded new decoration mods or older one were updated.

In process of changing config it might spam you a bunch of errors but these can be just ignored, windows just simply doesn't let me to supress them.
